Hate the colors used on the WP 2.8 admin plugins page? Love WP 2.6/2.7's color scheme? Then this plugin is for you!

== Description ==

If you used Wordpress 2.6/2.7 and upgraded to the 2.8 series, you'll notice that your admin plugins page has lost its personality.

Namely:

*"Where did that awesome green active plugins color go?  I can't tell which plugins are activated or deactivated!"*

Hence the genesis of this small and nifty plugin.

If you're **not** using WP 2.8+, you *don't* need this plugin!


== Installation ==

**For Wordpress users**

1. Upload `green-active-plugins.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


**For Wordpress MU users**
1. Upload `green-active-plugins.php` to the `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory and all your MU blogs will enjoy this plugin or you can activate the plugin individually on each sub-blog like regular Wordpress users (see above)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Okay, so what does this plugin really do? ###

This is a very small plugin that adds a little CSS to the *WP 2.8+ admin area* and changes the admin plugins color scheme to the familiar colors of the WP 2.6/2.7 series.

Specifically:

* Active plugins are now colored green, instead of white.
* Inactive plugins are now white, instead of gray.
* The plugin update message prompt is now center-aligned, instead of aligned left.

Try it out! You'll see the difference!

If you're **not** using WP 2.8+, you *don't* need this plugin!


### So Green Active Plugins! doesn't change the plugin page layout to WP 2.6/2.7's layout? ###

Green Active Plugins! *only* changes the colors.

Try using *Green Active Plugins!* in tandem with [Ozh's Better Plugin Page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ozh-better-plugin-page/).


### Does this plugin do wonders if I'm color-blind? ###
